Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) represent a novel deep learning framework designed to address scientific computing problems by integrating neural networks with the governing physical laws, typically expressed as nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs),

Core Concept and Purpose
PINNs are neural networks that are trained to solve supervised learning tasks while simultaneously respecting given laws of physics. They aim to provide data-driven solutions and discoveries of PDEs. This approach is particularly valuable in scenarios where data acquisition is costly or information is partial (referred to as the "small data regime"), as traditional state-of-the-art machine learning techniques often lack robustness and convergence guarantees in such situations. By incorporating prior physical knowledge, PINNs act as a regularization agent, constraining the space of admissible solutions and amplifying the information content of the available data, allowing them to generalize well even with limited training examples.

Key Mechanisms and Components
1. Universal Function Approximation: PINNs employ deep neural networks as universal function approximators to directly tackle nonlinear problems, avoiding the need for prior assumptions, linearization, or local time-stepping.
2. Automatic Differentiation (Autograd): This is a crucial component. PINNs exploit automatic differentiation (like PyTorch's autograd [Conversation History, 83]) to differentiate the neural networks with respect to their input coordinates (e.g., space and time) and model parameters. This allows for the direct computation of terms like ut (time derivative) or uxx (second spatial derivative) from the neural network's output, which are then used to form the physics-informed residual.
3. Physics-Informed Neural Network (Residual Network):
    ◦ If u(t, x) is approximated by a deep neural network, then a "physics-informed neural network," f(t, x), is defined as the left-hand side of the PDE (e.g., f := ut + N[u]).
    ◦ This f(t, x) network is derived by applying the chain rule using automatic differentiation. It shares the same parameters as the network representing u(t, x), but may have different activation functions due to the action of the differential operator.
4. Custom Loss Functions:
    ◦ The learning process involves minimizing a mean squared error (MSE) loss function.
    ◦ This loss typically comprises multiple terms:
        ▪ MSEu (or SSEn for discrete models) enforces adherence to initial and boundary training data on u(t, x).
        ▪ MSEf (or SSEb/SSEn+1 for discrete models) enforces the structure imposed by the PDE at a finite set of collocation points.
    ◦ This "custom" construction of activation and loss functions is a key distinguishing feature of PINNs from other machine learning applications in computational physics that treat models as black boxes.
5. Regularization: The inclusion of the PDE-enforcing MSEf term in the loss function acts as a regularization mechanism. This allows PINNs to be effectively trained with small datasets, enhancing robustness and generalization, which is crucial in scientific fields where data acquisition is expensive.
6. Activation Functions: Common deep feed-forward neural network architectures in PINNs use hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation functions. Tanh is a non-linear and differentiable function.
